# Meal Planner
This project is built using NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB and Bootstrap for COMP2106 at Georgian College using theme from https://bootswatch.com/.  

**Some notes**: I tried many things that ***did. not. work.***   

I tried:  

- another social login (github seemed pretty straightforward so I tried that) - Doesn't work, but I commented out the code because I don't know what I did wrong. I just get a security error when I click through to log in. As far as I can tell my uris all match, my callback, everything looks ok to me on both ends...  

- integrating a calendar (using Kendo and Tui plugins, among a couple others). I could get it to work fine in another app I created to try it out, but in my assignment app...just nope. 

- using Vue, at some point...as with the calendar, I could use Vue components fine in the test app I created, but couldn't implement it in my assignment.  

- image upload (using multer) 17 different ways...it was around this point that I managed to break my app, Postman, and my hopes and dreams.
